# PhotonicCraft
This is a hitherto unreleased Minecraft mod that adds a variety of items relating
to light and photonics, such as

- lasers (colored)
- mirrors
- prisms
- various tools
- a radio that actually plays audio streams (you need ComputerCraft or OpenComputers to transmit)
- microwave ovens

and much more.

This mod was developed starting from 2014 up until 2018, It was never released before, because
it was never completely tested for balance and it was never probably "finished". Therefore, it
might be very much unbalanced and not recommended for serious survival servers. It is now being
open-sourced and released for the first time for archival purposes. You are free to continue
developing this mod, pursuant to the terms of the license described in the file `LICENSE.TXT`.

The mod was originally written for Forge for Minecraft 1.7. A 1.8 port might exist, but that is
not certain. The most recent version (which probably also has new features compared to that for
1.7) is for Minecraft 1.12, likewise for Forge.

No proper documentation is provided and the code may be very messy indeed. You explore this
code base at your own risk.

## How to setup
I wish I'd still remember.
